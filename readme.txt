A simple plugin to fix the html unsecure mixed content error

== Description ==

It easily solves the problem of mixed unsafe content.

Once a web page has its contents, such as CSS, JavaScript or graphics loads unencrypted, the browser reports the whole website as unsafe.

This message will appear with this or similar texts "Connection is not secure" and "Parts of this page are not secure. This can e.g. be graphics. ".

Now you can check and correct all posts, comments, plugins and the theme ...

Or you simply install "SSL Fixit".
Finished. There is nothing to configure.

The plugin simply replaces all http: // in the output with https: //.

However, if you still need unencrypted links, you can not use this plugin.
But that should / should be there in the meantime only in exceptional cases.
